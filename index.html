        <h1>Week 2 blog</h1>
        <p>I have learnt many things about HTML in week 2 this week. I have learnt about semantics with tags such as
            header and nav CSS such as inline, internal and external CSS. In addition learnt about different styling such as font-family, Google fonts, colours and 
        background-colour.</p>
