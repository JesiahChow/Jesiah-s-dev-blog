        <h1 style="text-align:center ;">Week 2 blog</h1>
        <p>I have learnt many things about HTML in week 2 this week. I have learnt about semantics elements such as
            header and nav. I have learnt how to style my webpage using CSS such as inline, internal and external CSS. In addition learnt about different styling 
            such as font-family, Google fonts, colours and 
            background-colour.</p>
