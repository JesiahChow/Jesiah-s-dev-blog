        <h2>Week 2 blog</h2>
        <p>I have learnt many things about HTML in week 2 this week. I have learnt about semantics elements such as
            header and nav.<br> I have learnt how to style my webpage using CSS such as inline, internal and external CSS.<br>In addition learnt about different styling 
            such as font-family, Google fonts, colours and 
            background-colour.</p>
        <h2>Week 3 blog</h2>
        <p>In week 3, I have learnt about forms and how to create them. There are many types of forms such as text, radio button and checkbox.<br>
        I also learned more in-depth on CSS by creating classes,id for elements to style more specifically<br>
    and learned how to style descendant elements. For styling our CSS, I get to know about borders, background and the different rgb<br>
colours that can be used. In addition, with media query, I get to reduce my work to a width to accomodate to the resolution of a mobile phone<br>
Next will be positioning where I learned about relative, absolute and fixed and how Z-index is applied to those positions only.<br>
Followed by flexboxes which it can adapt to any layout to suit its content. Lastly, wireframe. Which is like a planning design for<br>
your website which helps you generate ideas quickly.  </p>
<h2>Week 4 blog</h2>
<p>In week 4, I have learnt how to use flexboxes to flex items in certain layout and responsive images<br>
    so that images and texts are able to flex and fit in different resolutions especially mobile layout.
</p>
<h2>Week 5 blog</h2>
<p>Week 5 was asynchronous learning where I learn javascript basics and DOM manipulation<br>
and style elements, div and id using javascript.</p>
<h2>Week 6 blog</h2>
<p>In week 6, we learnt more about javascript, where I learnt how to add functions, classes and objects on javascript<br>
week 6 lessons were follow up of week 5.</p>

<h2>Week 7</h2>
<p>Week 7 we learnt how to use DOM which stands for document object model, where I was exposed to the DOM tree and learn how to access<br>
elements by referring to the DOM tree. In addition, I learnt how to create events such as when a user clicks a button, an event happens.<br>
Adding additional feedbacks or commments to users who had for example typed wrongly in a form for validation.Lastly, I learnt about JSON storage.<br>
Storing objects in a local storage and treat it as an associative array and to convert from JavaScript object to string and vice-versa using .stringify() and .parse().</p>
<h2>Week 8</h2>
<p>In week 8, I learnt jQuery where it is a simplified version of javascript which helps simplify event handling.<br> For example, 
to select elements, in javascript, we type like this:document.querySelectorAll('li.hot'); whereas in jQuery, we type like this:$('li.hot');.<br>
I learnt how to find elements using DOM traversal method such as .parent() and .sibling(). Using the clone method allows me to clone the selected elements.<br>
Finally, I learnt about get and set attributes to remove or get attributes.Next is API, where I learnt about AJAX, where I can send and reuqest data from  a server.<br>
Such as finding the weather temperature. When a user enters what is the temperature at their location, the API gets the data and replies the user.<br>
</p>
<h2>Week 9</h2>
<p>In week 9, we learnt bootstrap, where I learnt to use bootstrap which they had already done the programs for you.<br>
For example, if I want to create a form i do not have to do it manually as bootstrap had already done it for you. I can just copy and paste the codes.<br>
Also the forms are flexed to a mobile layout which helps make my website responsive. Lastly, there are additional materials such as charts and tables to convey data.</p>
<h2>Week 12</h2>
<p>In week 12, I was introduced to restDB, where i can create my own database in it and put in my website using the API key found in the database I had ceated in restDB.</p>
<h2>Week 13</h2>
<p>For week 13, I learnt the various mistakes made for our assignment 1 website such as readme file and github.</p>
<h2>Week 14</h2>
<p>In week 14, I learnt about lottie animations, how it can be used for our assignment 2.Examples of lottie animations are loading screens and other forms of animations.<br>
I learnt how to add them into my html file and run them.</p>
