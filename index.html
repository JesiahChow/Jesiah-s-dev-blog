        <h2>Week 2 blog</h2>
        <p>I have learnt many things about HTML in week 2 this week. I have learnt about semantics elements such as
            header and nav.<br> I have learnt how to style my webpage using CSS such as inline, internal and external CSS.<br>In addition learnt about different styling 
            such as font-family, Google fonts, colours and 
            background-colour.</p>
        <h2>Week 3 blog</h2>
        <p>In week 3, I have learnt about forms and how to create them. There are many types of forms such as text, radio button and checkbox.<br>
        I also learned more in-depth on CSS by creating classes,id for elements to style more specifically<br>
    and learned how to style descendant elements. For styling our CSS, I get to know about borders, background and the different rgb<br>
colours that can be used. In addition, with media query, I get to reduce my work to a width to accomodate to the resolution of a mobile phone<br>
Next will be positioning where I learned about relative, absolute and fixed and how Z-index is applied to those positions only.<br>
Followed by flexboxes which it can adapt to any layout to suit its content. Lastly, wireframe. Which is like a planning design for<br>
your website which helps you generate ideas quickly.  </p>
<h2>Week 4 blog</h2>
<p>In week 4, I have learnt how to use flexboxes to flex items in certain layout and responsive images<br>
    so that images and texts are able to flex and fit in different resolutions especially mobile layout.
</p>
<h2>Week 5 blog</h2>
<p>Week 5 was asynchronous learning where I learn javascript basics and DOM manipulation<br>
and style elements, div and id using javascript.</p>
<h2>Week 6 blog</h2>
